"""
The custom implementations of the common data structures.

This packages includes the custom implementations of the common data structures
like arrays, queue, stack and etc. These implementations are only for learning
purpose and have no practical usage.

All the implemented classes are flatly imported here so that one can easily
import them by `data_structure.ClassName` instead of adding the module file
name in the middle.
